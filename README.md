# ADpwdsprayer.py

AD password sprayer relying on crackmapexec with advanced functionality and safety nets.


## Features

- Sprays **one password per interval** across all usernames
- Detects and logs:
  - Valid credentials (green)
  - Locked-out accounts (red)
  - Disabled or expired accounts (purple)
- Safety nets:
  - In case of any account getting locked out the script terminates
  - Optional **bait user spraying** with wrong password to detect lockout thresholds before affecting real users
- Logs:
  - All CME output to a file
  - Valid credentials to `valid_credentials.txt`
